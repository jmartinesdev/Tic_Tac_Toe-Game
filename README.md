# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Three in a Row, is a timeless and universally popular game. This simple yet engaging game is suitable for players of all ages. It involves two players, each taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols - typically an 'X' or an 'O'. The goal is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Rules 

1. **Game Grid**: The game is played on a 3x3 square grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players in the game. One player uses 'X' as their symbol, and the other uses 'O'.
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square.
4. **Objective**: The main objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Winning the Game**: The game is won by the first player to line up three of their symbols in a row.
6. **Draw**: If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game is a draw.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
