# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Three in a Row, is a timeless and universally popular game. This simple yet engaging game is suitable for players of all ages. It involves two players, each taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols - typically an 'X' or an 'O'. The goal is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Rules 

1. **Game Grid**: The game is played on a 3x3 square grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players in the game. One player uses 'X' as their symbol, and the other uses 'O'.
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square.
4. **Objective**: The main objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Winning the Game**: The game is won by the first player to line up three of their symbols in a row.
6. **Draw**: If all 9 squares are filled and, no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game is a draw.

## Strategy 

- **Offense**: Look for opportunities where you can get three symbols in a row.
- **Defense**: Keep an eye on your opponent's moves and block them if they are close to getting three in a row.
- **Corner Play**: Corners are powerful positions as they give multiple opportunities for creating a row.
- **Center Control**: Owning the center square can be advantageous, as it opens up several potential winning moves.
